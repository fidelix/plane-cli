# Caching

PlaneCLI uses a persistent disk-based cache to reduce redundant API calls. Most CLI commands resolve resources by name (fuzzy matching), which requires fetching full lists of projects, states, labels, and members from the Plane API. Without caching, a single `planecli wi list` across 10 projects can trigger 30+ API calls. With caching, warm runs eliminate >80% of those calls.

## How It Works

The cache sits between the CLI commands and the Plane API. When a command needs a list of resources (e.g., all states in a project), it first checks the local cache. On a cache hit, the data is returned instantly without any API call. On a miss, the data is fetched from the API, stored in the cache, and then returned.

```
Command → resolve/enrich → cache check → [HIT] → return cached data
                                        → [MISS] → Plane API → store in cache → return data
```

The cache is backed by SQLite (via [diskcache](https://github.com/grantjenks/python-diskcache)) and managed through the [cashews](https://github.com/Krukov/cashews) library.

### Storage Location

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| macOS | `~/Library/Caches/planecli/` |
| Linux | `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/planecli/` (default: `~/.cache/planecli/`) |

The cache is limited to **100 MB** with LRU eviction.

## What Is Cached

Only **slowly-changing resource definitions** are cached. Data that changes frequently is always fetched fresh.

### Cached Resources

| Resource | TTL | What It Is | Used For |
|----------|-----|------------|----------|
| Current user (`me`) | 1 hour | The authenticated user's profile | Resolving `--assign me`, `whoami` |
| Workspace members | 1 hour | The list of users in the workspace | Resolving `--assignee` flags, displaying assignee names |
| Project list | 5 min | All projects in the workspace | Resolving `--project` flags, `wi list` across all projects |
| Modules | 5 min | Module list per project | Resolving `--module` flags |
| Cycles | 5 min | Cycle list per project | Resolving cycle names |
| States | 10 min | State definitions per project (e.g., Todo, In Progress, Done) | Resolving `--state` flags, displaying state names/colors |
| Labels | 10 min | Label definitions per project | Resolving `--labels` flags, displaying label names/colors |
| Estimate points | 10 min | The `{id, value}` pairs used for effort estimates | Resolving `--estimate` flags (derived from work items — see [ADR-0003](adr/0003-sdk-escape-hatches.md)) |
| Work items | **2 min** | The work-item list per project | `wi list` and fuzzy name resolution |
| Comments | **1 min** | A single work item's comments | `comment ls` and the comments bundled by `wi show` |
| Relations | **1 min** | A single work item's relations | The relations bundled by `wi show` |

The TTLs follow a **volatility gradient** — the more often a resource changes, the shorter its lifetime. Comments and relations get the shortest TTL (1 min) because they are the most volatile, followed by work items (2 min); a short window still eliminates repeated calls when opening the same item several times in a row. The rationale for these tiers is recorded in [ADR-0004](adr/0004-disk-cache-ttls-and-keys.md).

Comments are cached **per work item** (keyed by `item_id`, not just the project), so two items never collide. The create/update/delete comment commands invalidate that item's entry (see [Cache Invalidation](#cache-invalidation)). Relations follow the same per-item pattern; `--blocked-by` / `--unblocked-by` invalidate the item's entry after mutating it.

### NOT Cached

| Resource | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| Documents / Pages | Change frequently |
| Individual resource lookups (by UUID/identifier) | Single-resource fetches should always be fresh |
| Intake queue (`intake ls`) | Goes straight to the API (there is no `cached_list_intake`), so the queue always reflects the current state |

**Important distinction**: What's cached is the *list of state definitions* — the lookup table that maps state UUIDs to display names and colors — not the association between a work item and its state. A work item's own fields are only ever as stale as its 2-minute TTL.

## Cache Keys

All cache keys are prefixed with a hash of the Plane `base_url` to isolate data across different Plane instances. This prevents returning cached data from one instance when you switch to another.

Key format: `{url_hash}:{resource}:{workspace}[:{project_id}[:{item_id}]]`

The optional `item_id` level scopes a resource to a single work item — comments and relations use it, so each item's comments and relations cache independently.

Examples:
- `a1b2c3d4e5f6:members:my-workspace`
- `a1b2c3d4e5f6:states:my-workspace:project-uuid-123`
- `a1b2c3d4e5f6:comments:my-workspace:project-uuid-123:item-uuid-456`
- `a1b2c3d4e5f6:relations:my-workspace:project-uuid-123:item-uuid-456`

## Cache Invalidation

### Automatic (After Writes)

Write commands automatically invalidate the relevant cache entry:

| Operation | Invalidates |
|-----------|-------------|
| `project create/update/delete` | Project list for the workspace |
| `state create/update/delete` | States for that project |
| `label create/update/delete` | Labels for that project |
| `module create/update/delete` | Modules for that project |
| `cycle create/update/delete` | Cycles for that project |
| `wi create/update/delete` | Work item list for that project |
| `intake create/accept/decline/delete` | Work item list for that project (an intake item wraps a work item) |
| `comment create/update/delete` | Comments for that specific work item |
| `wi update/create --blocked-by/--unblocked-by` | Relations for that specific work item |
| `configure` | Entire cache (credentials may have changed) |

Members are not mutated via the CLI, so they rely on TTL expiry only.

### Manual

Clear the entire cache:

```bash
planecli cache clear
```

## Bypassing the Cache

### Per-Command

Use `--no-cache` to skip cache reads for a single invocation. The fresh data still gets written to the cache, so subsequent runs benefit from it:

```bash
planecli --no-cache project list
```

### Via Environment Variable

```bash
export PLANECLI_NO_CACHE=1
planecli project list
```

Accepted values: `1`, `true`, `yes`.

## Error Handling

Cache failures never block CLI usage. If the cache is corrupted or the disk is full:

1. A warning is printed to stderr (e.g., `Warning: Cache read error, fetching from API: ...`)
2. The CLI falls back to direct API calls
3. The command completes normally

If the cache becomes corrupted beyond recovery, run `planecli cache clear` to delete it entirely.
