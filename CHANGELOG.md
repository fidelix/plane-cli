# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `wi update --module` adds the item to a module (same additive semantics as `wi create --module`)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-10-01

### Added
- `initiative` command group (`ls`/`show`/`create`/`update`/`delete`, workspace-scoped): strategic initiatives with state (`draft`, `planned`, `active`, `completed`, `closed`), lead, and start/end dates. Raw HTTP — the SDK initiative models are not JSON-serializable
- `release` command group (`ls`/`show`/`create`/`update`/`delete`): named versions with status (`unreleased`, `released`, `cancelled`), target/release dates, and lead. Project-scoped with `-p`, workspace-level without. Raw HTTP — the SDK has no release resource

## [0.6.0] - 2026-10-01

### Added
- Work item relations: `wi update --blocked-by REF` (repeatable) adds "blocked by" relations and `--unblocked-by REF` removes them; `wi create` accepts `--blocked-by` too. References take a UUID, identifier (`ABC-123`), or name. Writes are verified by re-reading the relations, so a silently ignored change fails loudly instead of reporting success. `wi show` displays `Blocked by`/`Blocking` sections (and `blocked_by`/`blocking` fields in `--json`), with `--no-relations` to skip the fetch
- Work item attachments: an `attachment` command group (`attach`/`upload`/`new`, `ls`) backed by a three-step upload flow (register for a presigned S3 URL, PUT the binary, PATCH `is_uploaded` and verify the write). Duplicate asset names are rejected unless `--force` is given
- `wi create`/`wi update` gain repeatable `-i/--image` flags that upload an image as an attachment and append it to the description HTML
- Several workspaces: optional `[name]` sections in `~/.plane_api` (slug, and optionally their own API key and base URL), a global `--workspace`/`-w NAME` flag that selects a section or any slug for one command, and `planecli workspaces` to list them without secrets. The existing file format keeps working unchanged

## [0.5.2] - 2026-09-25

### Changed
- Fork release containing the integrated upstream work-item, comment, attachment, document, and project improvements.

### Added
- `planecli intake` command group: `ls`, `create`, `accept`, `decline`, `delete`, `enabled` for project intake queues. Mutations take the work item UUID shown in the `Issue ID` column of `intake ls`. `accept`/`decline` require the project Admin role (the API silently ignores the change for lower roles, so the CLI verifies it and fails loudly). `delete` also permanently deletes the underlying work item for any status other than `accepted`

### Fixed
- `document create` no longer crashes before the API call: `CreatePage` now receives the required `description_html` at construction (`<p></p>` when `--content` is omitted)

## [0.5.1] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- `wi show` now includes the work item's comments in the same call. In `--json` output, the `comments` field is a list (`[]` when there are no comments) or `null` if the comment fetch fails — the work item is still returned and the command exits with code 0. In human-readable output, a `Comments` section follows the details, showing `(none)` or `(failed to load)` as appropriate
- `--no-comments` flag on `wi show` to skip fetching comments (the `comments` key is then omitted from JSON)
- `--limit` / `-l` option on `comment ls` (default 50): selects the N most recent comments, still rendered oldest to newest
- Per-work-item comment cache (1-minute TTL), invalidated on `comment create`/`update`/`delete`
- `--parent` filter on `wi list` to list the child work items of a parent, referenced by identifier (`ABC-123`), UUID, or name
- `--status` option on the `module create` and `module update` commands (values: `backlog`, `planned`, `in-progress`, `paused`, `completed`, `cancelled`), with English and Portuguese aliases (e.g. `em andamento`, `concluído`, `cancelado`) and validation with a clear error message

### Fixed
- `comment ls --limit 0` (or a negative value) now returns no results
- `wi show` no longer claims comments "failed to load" when the fetch was never attempted
- A failure to fetch members now degrades gracefully instead of aborting the comment fetch

### Documentation
- Added the Architecture Decision Records in `docs/adr/`, `docs/architecture.md`, and `AGENTS.md` at the root
- Renamed `docs/03-caching.md` to `docs/caching.md` and fixed the reference to the cached resource

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- Structured logging with loguru and fewer API calls via smart caching
- Automatic retry with tenacity for rate limits and transient API errors
- estimate_point UUID resolution in the `--estimate` parameter of the `wi` command

### Changed
- Removed the redundant Project column from the `wi list` output
- Updated the README terminology from "API Key" to "Personal Access Token"

### Fixed
- Fixed the SDK validation bypass for assignees/labels in work item resolution
- Removed the silent suppression of exceptions in the `wi` command's assignees filter

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- Disk caching of API responses with cashews for faster repeated requests
- Async execution of all API calls using `asyncio.to_thread` and parallel execution
- Comma-separated state and label filtering in the `wi list` command
- Color styling for labels, states, priorities, and work item tables
- Commands for managing cycles, labels, and states
- Comment update and delete operations
- `--project` became optional in `wi list`, listing all projects when omitted
- Separator lines and vertical spacing in table output
- Comprehensive test coverage for config, fuzzy matching, and resource resolution

### Changed
- Migrated all API calls from synchronous to asynchronous with a thread pool and semaphore-based rate limiting
- Rewrote the README with improved structure, a quick-start guide, and a complete command reference
- Added a Makefile with development tasks
- Updated the installation instructions with the `uv tool install` option

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- Initial release of PlaneCLI
- CLI application with commands for projects, work items, comments, documents, users, and modules
- Configuration via arguments, environment variables (`PLANE_BASE_URL`, `PLANE_API_KEY`, `PLANE_WORKSPACE`), and the `~/.plane_api` file
- Fuzzy resource search using rapidfuzz
- Rich table output (stderr) and JSON output (stdout) with the `--json` flag
- Smart resource resolution: UUID, identifier (e.g. `ABC-123`), or name search
- Cursor-based pagination in resource listing
